# chatty
A Telegram chatbot utilizing Markov chains for humourous results.
 
 ## usage
 Before running, chatty must be configured by setting the following enviroment variables.
 
 ### ```CHATTY_BOT_TOKEN```
 Your telegram bot token goes here. Get it from BotFather on telegram.
 
 ### ```CHATTY_CHAT_ID```
 Set this to your chat ID so chatty knows which group to talk to! I do it this way rather than letting chatty join just any group so that random people cannot run up my VM quoats.

---

under no circumstances should you use this in your telegram group.
